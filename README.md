   I had the following issues completing this assignment:  


   - I had to research how to create a .gitignore file  
   with the .DS_store included. The information was found  
   at: <https://gist.github.com/lohenyumnam/2b127b9c3d1435dc12a33613c44e6308>  


   - I also have a habit of pushing commits to the remote  
   repository as they are committed rather than waiting  
   until the end to push all commits. Therefore, by the  
   time I'd gotten to the bottom of this assignment, I had  
   already pushed all of my commits.
